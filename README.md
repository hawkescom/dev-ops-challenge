## Dev Ops Engineer Exercise
This exercise is intended to see how you think and what types of design styles and patterns you would use if you were selected to work at Living As One.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive exercise but instead to show us how you solve real world problems and implement a solution.

## User Story Definition
As a user of our system, I want to replace our traditional message broker with Kafka.  To do this I need a new Kafka service deployed using the following:

* Kafka
* Kubernetes 
* Kustomize 

## Acceptance Criteria

* Please send a link to the GitHub repo via matt.hawkes@livingasone.com when you are complete.
